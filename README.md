# cruiseControl-repo

The purpose of this project is to build a model of car cruise in real situation. Assume a car drives from Kansas city to our mile high city Denver, the elevation change from 277 meter (909 feet) to 1609 meter (1 mile). The distance from Kansas city to Denver is 970 km. 

There are several conditions we need to take into consideration. 
* The **oxygen** content decrease due to the increases of elevation. Without rich oxygen, combustion engine cannot burn gasoline totally.
* The **temperature** decrease 0.6 Celsius by every 100 meters elevation gain. 
* **Fehn wind** flows from Rockey Mountain to Great Plain, slow down the speed of the car. 
* **changeing gear** of the car, which will also change its speed.
